This repository demonstrates a common mistake in Rust: accessing memory after it has been freed. The `bug.rs` file contains code that leads to undefined behavior. The `bugSolution.rs` provides the corrected version, illustrating how to avoid this error.  This is a critical error that can cause crashes, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities.  Understanding how memory management works in Rust is essential to avoid such bugs.
